This is where users can sign up. <br />

This app/directory is also where all the other account stuff will go (log in, settings, etc)<br />


Here is the form.<br />

<form method="POST" action="{% url 'account:signup' %}">
{% csrf_token %}
{{ form.as_p }}
<button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
